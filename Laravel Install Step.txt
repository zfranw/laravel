To install Laravel, I followed these steps:

    First i Install PHP: Laravel requires PHP to be installed on my system. I have ensured this by following command in MS Dos:

php -v

After that i Install Composer. Composer is a dependency management tool used by Laravel. It manages the installation of Laravel and its dependencies. To install Composer, I followed the official installation instructions provided on the Composer website (https://getcomposer.org/).Install the Laravel Installer globally by running the following Composer command:

composer global require laravel/installer

Verification of Installation: After installing the Laravel Installer, i have verify that it's installed correctly by running the following command:

laravel --version

Aftter all this step i have created a New Laravel Project by running the following command:


laravel new project-name

I also Replaced project-name with the desired name for my project.

Serve the Application in Server: for this i have used following command


cd project-name

To start a development server and run my Laravel application, use the following command:

    php artisan serve

    This will start a local development server, and you can access your Laravel application by visiting http://localhost:8000 in my server web browser.

That's how i have installed laravel in my computer
